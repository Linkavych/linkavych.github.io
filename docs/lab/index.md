# Lab Infrastructure

In order to analyze malware you need a lab environment. This section documents how I have
built out my home lab environment - which may not be the best for everyone. This works for
me, for now, but will no doubt change as I learn more and my process changes.

I will also include other analysis of infrastructure used by adversaries to attack systems. C2
servers, proxies, and other nodes employed by adversaries to obscure their identity, and
accomplish their desired ends.
